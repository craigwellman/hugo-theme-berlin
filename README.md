# Berlin

Berlin is a simple Bootsrap 4 based Hugo theme for a blog website. It uses pure [Bootrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) without any custom css and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com) Web Font for icons. The idea is to give you a framework for easy further customization (e.g. additional css, own fonts or bootstrap theme). This theme includes a sample blog for demonstration.

<small>This theme is based on [Hugo Bootstrap v4 Theme](https://github.com/Xzya/hugo-bootstrap)</small>

## Installation (under Windows)

Asumed you have installed hugo already you should:	

1. Open the Windows command prompt

2. Run `hugo new site c:\myblog`. A new hugo project will be created.

3. Switch to that newly created folder with `cd c:\myblog`.

Now you need to install the Berlin theme. You can do that by cloning the GitHub repository with Git or by manually copying the files.
